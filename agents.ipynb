    "\n",
    "An agent, as defined in 2.1, is anything that can perceive its <b>environment</b> through sensors, and act upon that environment through actuators based on its <b>agent program</b>. This can be a dog, a robot, or even you. As long as you can perceive the environment and act on it, you are an agent. This notebook will explain how to implement a simple agent, create an environment, and implement a program that helps the agent act on the environment based on its percepts.\n",

    "Let us now see how we define an agent. Run the next cell to see how `Agent` is defined in agents module."
